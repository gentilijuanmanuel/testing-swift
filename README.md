# Learning to test Swift

Repository created to track the learning process of Unit testing and UI Testing in Swift.
It consists in a simple SwiftUI app that contains testeable models, services, helpers, extensions, etc. All these files are not being used in the app, they only are present to be tested in the Unit Test/UI Test target.
Files are grouped depending on the article/video/etc. I used as a resource for learning.

## External resources used as inspiration in order to practice Unit/UI testing
